MUST DO
* Check error/warning messages for usage of typeToString(). Now there are a lot of places where just a number is printed.
* Check source files for FIXME and TODO tags, and fix them... ;-)
* Implement 'returns are last statement in block' check

COULD DO
* Dead code removal from AST generated assembly code
* Constant folding
* If-else ternary operator optimization when condition is constant
