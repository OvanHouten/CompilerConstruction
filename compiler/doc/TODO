MUST DO
* Allow procedure style function calling. Currently the compiler (type check) does not allow this.
* Implement better return statement check. The spec is rather loose when it comes to the return statement.
* Check error/warning messages for usage of typeToString(). Now there are a lot of places where just a number is printed.
* Check source files for FIXME and TODO tags, and fix them... ;-)
* Implement 'returns are last statement in block' check
* Implement a 'can't change var-loop variable' check. The loop counter is readonly for expressions inside the loop!

SHOULD DO
* Extract SymbolTable code into single file and remove redundant code (currently we have multiple location where STE's are created...)

COULD DO
* Dead code removal from AST generated assembly code
* Constant folding
* If-else ternary operator optimization when condition is constant
* Use 'sons' traversal for type context (scope) analysis.

DONE
* Implement do-while code generation
