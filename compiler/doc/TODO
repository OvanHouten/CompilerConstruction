MUST DO
* Allow procedure style function calling. Currently the compiler (type check) does not allow this.
* Implement 'returns are last statement in block' check
* Implement do-while code generation
* Implement a 'can't change var-loop variable' check. The loop counter is readonly for expressions inside the loop!
* Check error/warning messages for usage of typeToString(). Now there are a lot of places where just a number is printed.
* Check source files for FIXME and TODO tags, and fix them... ;-)

SHOULD DO
* Extract SymbolTable code into single file and remove redundant code (currently we have multiple location where STE's are created...)
* Remove array related nodes from the AST and revert that commit in the Array branch.
* Implement a compiler optimization 'O' flag and have the compiler act accoringly. (We already have a coouple of 'built in' optimizations in the code generation phase that might need to be switchable)
* Refactor functions for translating enum values from using switch-statement into using string arrays.  

COULD DO
* Dead code removal from AST generated assembly code
* Constant folding
* If-else and ternary operator optimization when condition is constant
* Use 'sons' traversal for type context (scope) analysis. (tricky!)
* Reuse of for-loop variables for sequential (non nested) for-loops.
* Make the number of optimizations attempt configurable via command line options.
* Peephole optimizations (could be done pure AST based, pure generated code based or mixed)
